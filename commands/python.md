# Python Data Analysis

Invoke the data-analyst:lang-python skill for language-specific patterns.

For complex analysis, follow the data-analyst:data-workflow skill (brainstorm → plan → execute).

## Quick Mode

For simple requests (one-liner, quick transform, syntax question): answer directly using lang-python patterns.

## Full Workflow Mode

For multi-step analysis:

1. **Brainstorm** - Understand objective, data, constraints
2. **Plan** - Define tasks with validation criteria
3. **Execute** - Implement task by task

## Capabilities

- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Statistical tests and analysis
- Visualizations (Plotly, Seaborn)
- Data transformations and pipelines
- Report generation

## Language

Respond in the same language as the user.
